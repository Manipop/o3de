    // using the meshInfoIndex from the VBuffer to figure out if any given pixel needs to be rendered with the current draw-call, or can be skipped.
    // Since the draw-packet IDs can be different for a mesh for different deferred DrawListTags, we provide the drawPacketIds for all meshes for the 
    // current DrawListTag
